#### :dart: Instructions
In this lab you will practice creating and accessing objects. You will also practice manipulating objects. After that, you will shift from objects to classes to practice creating multiple instances of the same object.

Download the exercise content and open the lab.js file, and attempt as many problems as you can.

The goal is to get through as many questions as you can. The questions will become more difficult as you advance. Some questions will cover topics not taught in class. This is intentional. Use resources online to help you figure out the solutions.

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution implemented solves all exercise's requirements.

After cloning the project, run `node lab.js` on a terminal window to see the logs printed.
