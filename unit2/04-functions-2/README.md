#### :dart: Instructions
Practice with higher order functions, callbacks, arrow functions, and higher order array methods.

Download the exercise content and work through the 3 files. Itâ€™s recommended that you start with `callbackAndHigherOrder.js`, and finish with `arrayMethods.js`, but feel free to jump around. Just make sure to attempt every problem.

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution implemented solves all exercise's requirements.

After cloning the project, run `node arrayMethods.js` and `node callbackAndHigherOrder.js` on a terminal window to see the logs printed.
