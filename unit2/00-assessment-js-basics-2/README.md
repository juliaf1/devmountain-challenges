**Part 1: Skills Practice**

In this section, you’ll complete a series of practice problems that will ensure you practice the syntax and coding concepts from this unit’s lessons.

Open the files called `home.js`, `menu.js`, `cart.js`, `orders.js` and `employees.js` and complete the problems that are described in the comments.


**Part 2: Design**

- Using Figma, create at least 3 low-fidelity wireframes for the restaurant’s website.
- Additionally, create a style guide that includes a color scheme, typography, and at least one photo.
- Create at least 1 high-fidelity mockup of one of your wireframes.
