#### :dart: Instructions

Using the same process that we used during the demo, you’re going to create at least 2 views for an ecommerce store using Figma. You’ll need to create the wireframes and mockups for each view, as well as a style guide for the whole project.

[Check Design Lab Figma Links](#figma)

**Part 1: Wireframe**

Decide what kind of store you’ll be making (Some ideas: clothing, books, food, makeup, sports, camping gear, games, electronics, auto parts) and create the wireframes for a individual product view and for a cart page

- Product view requirements
  - Header
  - At least 1 picture of the product
  - Product name
  - Product price
  - Product description
  - Buy button
  - Anything else you want to include

- Cart view requirements
  - Pictures of each item
  - Names of each item
  - Quantity of each item
  - Prices of each item
  - Total price
  - Checkout button
  - Anything else you want to include

**Part 2: Style guide**

Create a style guide frame in your Figma workspace. Make note of all the rules you want to define about your styling.

- Decide on a color scheme
- Decide on a font or two
- Create layout and spacing rules
- Write icons/illustrations/picture rules
- Plan out any reusable elements (buttons or cards)
- Write other dos and don’ts of your design guide

**Part 3: Mockups**

Create the high fidelity mockups of your views based on the wireframes and your style guide.

- Create the basic layout
- Add in the text and images
- Tweak the sizes and spacing to match your style guide

**Extra: More Views**

If you have completed 2 views, add any more you’d like from the following list:
- Home Page
- All Products Page
- Pages for different sections of products (Fiction, Nonfiction, Childrens, etc. for a bookstore)
- Login Page
- Settings Page
