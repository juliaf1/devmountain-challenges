# Devmountain Foundations
### Week 3
### Add To Zero Challenge

---

#### :dart: Instructions
Given an array of numbers, console.log `True` if any two numbers in the array add to zero, otherwise log `False`.

For example:

```
[1, 4, 11, 2, 37, -4] should log True because 4 and -4 add to 0.

[0, 21, 33, 6, 0, -9] should log True because 0 and 0 add to 0.

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should log False because no two numbers add to 0.
```

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution implemented uses a `for loop` inside a `forEach` method, checking if there are any numbers that add to zero. If there is, it breaks the loop returning `True`.

After cloning the project, run `node addToZero.js` on a terminal window to see the logs printed.
