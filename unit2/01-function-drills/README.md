### Function Drills

---

#### :dart: Instructions
In this lab you will practice functions. Functions that simply do something, functions that return values. Difficulties will range from beginner to advanced.

Download the exercise content and open the `functionDrillsLab.js` file. Attempt as many problems as you can.

The goal is to get through as many of the problems as you can. A few questions will cover topics not taught in class. This is intentional. Use resources online to help you figure out the solutions.

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution implemented solves all exercise's requirements.

After cloning the project, run `node functionDrillsLab.js` on a terminal window to see the logs printed.
