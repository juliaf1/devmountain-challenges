#### Brainstorming

As a **User**, I can sign up with my `email` and `password`.<br>
I can save my `name` and create an `username` so other people can see the recipes I created and find my profile.<br>
I can set an `avatar` to improve my personal branding.<br>
I can `verify` my email to make my account more secure.<br>

I can create or browser for **Recipes** that have a `title`, `prep time`, `description`, `ingredients` (which are made of quantity + the ingredient itself) and `instructions`.<br>
When I create a recipe, I can decide if it's `public` and other users can see it or `private` and only me or selected users can see it.<br>
I can share a private/unlisted recipe with other users via a `shared link`.<br>
I can invite other users via email to manage (edit details, instructions and ingredients of) a recipe, they become `co-authors`.<br>
I can like public recipes and see how many `likes` that recipe has.

I can add a recipe full ingredient's list or pick individual items to my **Grocery List**.<br>
I can create multiple private grocery lists to better plan my month and `name` them to identify each from my collection of lists.<br>
I can see the ingredients of my grocery list grouped by their recipes.<br>
I can edit the `amount` of the ingredients on my grocery list or remove individual ingredients.<br>
I can easily clean all ingredients out of my grocery list.<br>
I can `cross off` an ingredient of my grocery list to mark I already picked or bought it.<br>

I can add recipes to a private or public collection of saved recipes.<br>
I can create `public` or `private` collections of recipes and `name` them by their related **Occasions**.<br>
I can see my occasions and see the recipes saved in those collections.<br>
I can remove recipes from my collections.<br>
I can add a short `description` to my occasion so me and/or other people can gain more details about that group of recipes.<br>
I can share a private/unlisted occasion with other users via a `shared link`.<br>
I can invite other users via email to manage (add/remove recipes of) a collection.<br>
