const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the seconnd step, in which business and data models are discussed and refined"
const design = "The third step is focused overall on user experience. This is when the user interface and user journey are designed"
const implementation = "Developers will develop, aka code the software"
const testingAndIntegration = "Developers will integrate features to an environment users can have access and QAs will test"
const maintain = "Support, fix bugs, maintain code and hosting service, upgrade dependencies"
