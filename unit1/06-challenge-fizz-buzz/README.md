### Week 2
### Fizz Buzz

---

#### :dart: Instructions
Write a program that counts from 1 to 50 in fizzbuzz fashion.

To do so, loop from 1 to 50 (inclusive). Each time through, if the number is evenly divisible by 3, say ‘fizz’. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, say ‘buzz’. If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, say ‘fizzbuzz’. Otherwise, say the number.

```

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution implemented solves all exercise's requirements.

After cloning the project, run `node fizzBuzz.js` on a terminal window to see the fizz buzz challenge printed.
