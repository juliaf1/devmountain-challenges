#### :dart: Instructions
Given the starting code of:

```
x = 1
y = 2
```

Write a block of code that will print out the largest value.
To verify your code is working properly, try and change the values of x and y.
As an additional challenge, print out `The values are identical` if x and y have the same value.

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution implemented solves all exercise's requirements.

```
let x = 4
let y = 4

if (x > y) {
  console.log(`The largest value is x: ${x}`)
} else if (x < y) {
  console.log(`The largest value is y: ${y}`)
} else {
  console.log('The values are identical')
};
```
