# Devmountain Foundations
### Week 1
### Support Cryptogram

---

#### :dart: Instructions
Create a txt file and solve the cryptogram.

Theme: Your main avenues for support

```
A = Q
C = E
I = M
L = P
Q = N
Y = O
```

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution for the first class setup exercise:

```
QUEUE | PAIR-PROGRAMMING | ADVISOR MEETINGS | MESSAGE INSTRUCTOR OR MENTOR
----- | ---------------- | ------- -------- | ------- ---------- -- ------
AJCJC | LZPD-LDYFDZIIPQF | ZEWPBYD ICCUPQFB | ICBBZFC PQBUDJKUYD YD ICQUYD
```

After transcripting the first letters from the tips, I figured the last word "mentor" and moved on to decode the other letters in the following order: 

```
U = T
D = R
F = G
Z = A
P = I
B = S
J = U
K = C
E = D
W = V
```
