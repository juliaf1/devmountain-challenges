### Decode String

---

#### :dart: Instructions
Write a function that takes in a string and returns a string. A valid argument is a number followed by a sequence of letters.
The number in the string represents how many characters each letter should shift. For example:

```
"1a" should return "b"
"3ce" should return "fh"
"2fcjjm" should return "hello"
```

#### :sparkles: Solution
Solution implemented solves all exercise's requirements using a loop and the findIndex method on an alphabet array.
